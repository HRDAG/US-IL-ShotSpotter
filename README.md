# US-IL-ShotSpotter

This is a public repo for the data and analyses performed on emergency response data from the Chicago Office of Emergency Management & Communication ("OEMC") provided to our partners at the Invisible Institute and shared with us for the [missing persons](chicagomissingpersons.com/) project.

Analysis is ongoing and additional topics will be added to this repo over time.
